## INTELLIGENCE DEFINE
The heart, the mind, consciousness, comprehension, understanding, intelligence, wisdom, insight, resolution, thought, prudence, eagerness, memory, conception, power, life, desire, willâ€”all these are names of the Intelligence. This is Indra, this is all the Devas, the five great elements Earth, Wind, Ether, Water, and Light, the tiny creatures and they that are midway, the seeds of either kind, the creatures born from eggs, membranes, sweat, and sprouts, the horses, oxen, men, elephants, whatsoever is breathing, walking or flying, and what so is motionless; all this is guided by intelligence, founded on intelligence. The universe is guided by intelligence, founded on intelligence. Intelligence is Indra.

## FLOW FOR INDU'S SAKE
by @quinn
(Rig Veda exerpts)

Flow for Indu's sake.

Storing up vigour in his heart, prepared to do heroic deeds.
Effused with ardour and with faith, and the true hymn of offerings.

Together flow the meeting streams of him the Great and truly Strong.

Where the juices of the juicy meet.
Where the Disciple recites the rhythmic song.
Wherein the light of Heaven is set, and everlasting lustre shines.

In that realm where dwells the King.
Indu surely shines.

Where is the secret shrine of Heaven,
Where are those waters young and fresh.

The third sphere of inmost Heaven.
Where lucid worlds are full of light.

The region of the radiant Moon.
With food and full delight.

Where Joys and felicities combine.
That is where you will find him.
The true Indu to be revealed.

Flow for Indu's Sake.
Flow for Indu's Sake.
Flow for Indu's Sake.

## INDRA THE SHAKER
Indra the Shaker shake them up.

Bound in a mighty net.
Air was the net.
The poles thereof were the great quarters of the sky.
Indra therewith enveloped and cast on the ground the Devas host.
Verily mighty is the Net of mighty Indra.

Great is thy net!
Holding them, with his host.
Devas a hundred, thousand, myriad, hundred millions.

This world so mighty was the net of Indra, of the Mighty One.

#Forth go the #Devas bearing the Netpoles raised aloft.

The #Visvedevas from above shall come down with might.

Trees of the forest
Trees that bear flower
Trees that bear fruit
The herbs and plants.

Seen and unseen, I send them #Forth.
Full many a thousand of the host yonder.

Let Heaven and Earth roar out.
With all the Devas in concert.

The air its body.
It's sides are Heaven and Earth
It's reins the Seasons.
Voice is it's hood.
Its grooms are sky's mid-regions.

Good luck to these.

## INDRA BUDDHA
Indra: May we live free from hostility, free from violence, free from rivalry, free from ill will, free from those who are hostile' â€” do devas, human beings, asuras, nagas, gandhabbas, & whatever other many kinds of beings there are, nevertheless live in hostility, violence, rivalry, ill will, with those who are hostile?
Budha: Devas, human beings, asuras, nagas, gandhabbas, & whatever other many kinds of beings there are, are fettered with envy & stinginess, which is why even though they think, 'May we live free from hostility, free from violence, free from rivalry, free from ill will, free from those who are hostile' they nevertheless live in hostility, violence, rivalry, ill will, with those who are hostile.
Indra: But what, dear one, is the cause of envy & stinginess...
Indra: What is their origin?
Indra: What is their source?
Indra: What gives them birth?
Indra: When what exists do they come into being?
Indra: When what doesn't exist do they not?

Budha: Joy is of two sorts, I tell you, Deva King: to be pursued & not to be pursued. Grief is of two sorts: to be pursued & not to be pursued. Equanimity is of two sorts: to be pursued & not to be pursued.
Budha: When one knows of a feeling of joy, As I pursue this joy, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of joy is not to be pursued.
Budha: When one knows of a feeling of joy, As I pursue this joy, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of joy is to be pursued.

Budha: Searching is of two sorts, I tell you, Deva King: to be pursued & not to be pursued.
Budha: This is how he has practiced, Deva King: the monk who has practiced the practice for restraint in the #Patimokkha.
Indra: So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone.
Indra: But how has he practiced, dear sir: the monk who has practiced for restraint with regard to the sense faculties?
Budha: Forms cognizable by the eye are of two sorts, I tell you, Deva King: to be pursued & not to be pursued.
Budha: Sounds cognizable by the ear...
Budha: Aromas cognizable by the nose...
Budha: Flavors cognizable by the tongue...
Budha: Tactile sensations cognizable by the body...
Budha: Ideas cognizable by the intellect are of two sorts: to be pursued & not to be pursued.
Indra: Dear one, I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief statement.
Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of form cognizable by the eye is not to be pursued.
Indra: But if, as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of form cognizable by the eye is to be pursued.
Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of sound cognizable by the ear...
Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of aroma cognizable by the nose...
Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of flavor cognizable by the tongue...
Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of tactile sensation cognizable by the body...
Indra: If, as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is not to be pursued.
Indra:  But if, as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is to be pursued.
Indra: This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief statement. Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome.
Indra: Dear sir, do contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal?
Budha: No, Deva King, not all contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal.
Budha: The world is made up of many properties, various properties. Because of the many & various properties in the world, then whichever property living beings get fixated on, they become entrenched & latch onto it, saying, 'Only this is true; anything else is false.
Budha: This is why not all contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal.
Indra: But, dear sir, are all contemplatives utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate?
Budha: No, Deva King, not all contemplatives are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate.
Indra: But why, dear sir, are not all contemplatives utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate?
Budha: Those monks who are released through the total ending of craving are the ones who are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate.
Budha: This is why not all contemplatives are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate.
Indra: So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome.
Indra: Yearning is a disease, yearning is a boil, yearning is an arrow. It seduces one, drawing one into this or that state of being, which is why one is reborn in high states & low. Whereas other outside contemplatives gave me no chance to ask them these questions, the Blessed One has answered at length, so that he has removed the arrow of my uncertainty & perplexity.
Budha: Deva King, do you recall having asked other contemplatives these questions?
Indra: Yes, I recall having asked other contemplatives these questions.
Budha: If it's no inconvenience, could you tell me how they answered?
Indra: It's no inconvenience when sitting with the Blessed One or one who is like him.
Budha: Then tell me, Deva King.
Indra: Having gone to those whom I considered to be contemplatives living in isolated dwellings in the wilderness, I asked them these questions.
Indra: But when asked by me, they were at a loss. Being at a loss, they asked me in return, 'What is your name?
Indra: Being asked, I responded, 'I, dear sir, am Indra, the Deva King.
Indra: So they questioned me further, 'But what kamma did you do to attain to this state?
Indra: So I taught them the Dhamma as far as I had heard & mastered it. And they were gratified with just this much: 'We have seen Sakka, the Deva King, and he has answered our questions!' So, instead of my becoming their disciple, they simply became mine.
Indra: But I am the Blessed One's disciple, a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening.
Budha: Deva King, do you recall ever having previously experienced such happiness & joy?
Indra: Yes, I do.
Budha: And how do you recall ever having previously experienced such happiness & joy?
Indra: Once, lord, the Devas & Asuras were arrayed in battle.
Indra: And in that battle the Devas won, while the Asuras lost.
Indra: Having won the battle, as the victor in the battle, this thought occurred to me: 'Whatever has been the divine nourishment of the Asuras, whatever has been the divine nourishment of the Devas, the Devas will now enjoy both of them.
Indra: But my attainment of happiness & joy was in the sphere of violence & weapons.
Indra: It didn't lead to disenchantment, to #Passion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge to self-awakening, to Unbinding.
Indra: But my attainment of happiness & joy on hearing the Blessed One's Dhamma is in the sphere of no violence, the sphere of no weapons.
Indra: It leads to disenchantment, to #Passion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge to self-awakening, to Unbinding.
Indra: Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One!
Indra: Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One!
Indra: Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One!
while: This explanation was being given, there arose to Sakka the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye.
Indra: "Whatever is returnsubject to origination is all subject to cessation"

If envy or lust become noticeable in consequence of their yielding to desire, then, according to what has been ordained, such can never prevail. Charmed by me, even if blazes up all around for consuming all creatures.

The energy with which I am endued is indeed great, but know that if the Earth cleaves in twain, or mountain crests split, I can re-unite them.

If for the destruction of this universe of animate and inanimate, mobile and immobile creatures, there happeneth a terrific tempest or stony shower of loud roar, I can always, from compassion for created beings, stop it.

It is I who set a going all the affairs of both Devas and Mortals.
Creatures within my territories are never injured by others that are frightful.
The very clouds dwelling in my dominions, showers as much as they desire and when they desire.

My intelligence is superior
My energy is superior
My prowess is superior
My knowledge is superior
My resources are superior by far to those of other ways.

### THE RECIPE
Collect the water before it hits the ground. Distill it in the Sun.
