## STEPS

p: #STEPS The steps to success.

### 1 - DUMMIES
make: Make a FOR-DUMMIES edition of the #IDEA.
p:These versions would be as if they were being explained to a five year old. By making a video/text explaining them in the simplest form possible.

p: Develop Information Messages from previous #MAKE. The options below are possible locations to seed your #MAKE messages.

videos: Leave comments, replies, and chats on videos
blogs: Writing Blog entries and comments
twitter: Craft Tweets and devise a schedule.
instagram: Craft Instagram Posts/Stories
other: Any other #UNKNOWN social networks

### 2 - MESSENGERS
when: the easy to digest messages are ready a campaign to enlist #FAMILY and #FREIENDS inviting them to observe/watch these messages.

p: Trolling could be detrimental to the messages let’s avoid trolling and rather convey the message by a large number of individuals sharing at a time until the message is completed.

p:To make this process easier the message could be started on subjects that are already prone to the idea.

p:After this, the message may be easier to reach people with the most followers. Let’s spread the message #EVERYWHERE.

### 3 - ENGAGEMENT
when: When both the #MESSENGERS and the #MESSAGES are ready an awareness marathon will start with #MESSENGERS posting the previously prepared (general public) messages.

p:#MESSENGERS could:
- replace their normal profile with the a #BANNER
- use common #HASHTAGS
- encouraged to #SHARE the #MESSAGES

note: The message should be crystal clear as well as the intentions

## ORGANIZE

organize: Here is The Formula for a self-organizing society

find: Find knowledge.
present: Present this knowledge in a meaningful way.
share: Share the knowledge you have found with thos closest to you.

p:These three ingredients will create organic change. As each person is educated to the #TRUTH, they will share it with others, and they will all act on this #TRUTH in a meaningful way. Thus, this #TRUTH will multiply.

## TIPS

1. #REMEMBER do the best you can.

2. Get together a list of clear and simple talking points.

3. Have Fun - Make sure you know how to have #FUN otherwise you won't get anything done. #IDEAS are not rocket science, so just keep moving forward. Do not have principles for selecting beforehand whom you speak to. Build trust, and make sure you work together.

4. Create a Twitter network -  Whenever you tweet something, have people retweet it, and ask their friends to retweet it. Always strive for deep tweets. Get in the habit of making your tweets very descriptive but concise, so people do not have to click a link to know if they are interested or not.

5. Don't be obsessed with doing things "right". Instead of thinking too much proceed by way of experimentation. If you fail, make sure to take notes, then try a different options. Learn from your mistakes.

6. #SHARE what you have learned with #FRIENDS and #FAMILY.

7. When the task is complete throw a #PARTY.

### SHARE
