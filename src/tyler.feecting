  - #IDEAS: The base ideas we are working with.
    - #IMAGINE
        - IMAGINE: we plant #IDEAS
        - IMAGINE: we become #SEEDS to those #IDEAS
        - IMAGINE: we sow the world with those #SEEDS

        - IMAGINE: we finally find the #COURAGE needed
        - IMAGINE: we THE #IDEAS born from #IMAGINATION

        - IMAGINE: we are no longer afraid of #FEAR
        - IMAGINE: we #DRAW, #PAINT, #SING, #WRITE, #CREATE 'Reality'

        - IMAGINE: #INFORMATION is #KNOWLEDGE
        - IMAGINE: #KNOWLEDGE is #POWER
        - IMAGINE: the #SYSTEM built upon #INFORMATION, #KNOWLEDGE, and #POWER.

        - IMAGINE: we all synchronize to act in #HARMONY
        - IMAGINE: we thank all of Creation,
        - IMAGINE: this "#IDEA" goes #VIRAL.
        - #IMAGINE...

    - #CREATE
        - NOTE: Don't expect to 'evolve the #WORLD' until you have #EVOLVED
                yourself. The practice does not need #QUANTITY but #QUALITY

        - NOTE: TEN #PEOPLE WHO KNOW WOULD BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN A MILLION
                ARMED #ANARCHISTS.

        - STOP: being a #PASSIVE #USER
        - STOP: feeding negativity into your life: that which you feed, grows.
        - START: becoming an #ARTIST
        - START: being an #ARTIST

        - USE: your #IMAGINATION and #CREATIVITY to #INSPIRE the #FUTURE

        - STOP: poisoning your mind with bad news/TV/outlooks/etc. We ALL
        know the world is pretty messed up, yeah, but tuning your brain into
        that sort of negativity is going to help #NOBODY.

        - START: feeding Consciousness, Beauty and Truth within yourself, towards
        the people closest to you and then out into the world.

        The shortest and most powerful way to create from #ILLUSION into #REALITY
        is to see #BEAUTY all around you and within yourself, all the timE.

        #LOVE things and persons for what they are, JUST THE WAY THEY ARE, and
        not for what they "look like".

        Once you have done this, you'll be #FREE to decide which kind of things
        you would like to see #CHANGING.

        The shortest and most powerful way to get there is #CREATE the energy
        all around you and within yourself, all the #TIME.

        - FEEL: the #BEAUTY

        - SHARE: your #EXPERIENCES and #CREATIONS with #OTHERS: this is the single
        MOST important skill of the #IMAGINATION #ARTIST. #SHARE #CREATIONS with #OTHERS.

        - CREATE: the #SEEDS of something #BEAUTIFUL:
          - a wallpaper
          - a stencil
          - a game
          - a video
          - a message to the #FUTURE
          - #YOU are completely #FREE to choose what to #CREATE.

        - KNOW: that you can begin to Create:
          - YOU: have the #TOOLS and #CREATIVITY that you need
          - YOU: have the #PASSION to #CREATE and #SHARE beauty with the #WORLD
          - YOU: don't need to do #BIG things
          - YOU: just have to #START NOW.

        - WILL: to become a #REALITY #CREATOR by #ACTIVELY #CREATING your
        transformation from a #PASSIVE #USER to an #ACTIVE #ARTIST of #REALITY.

        - STOP: being #SILENT: #SHARE the #EXPERIENCE that you have #LIVED and
        the #BEAUTY that you have #CREATED.

        - WHEN: you have found yourself, you will Find The Others.
        - WHEN: you have found The Others, you will find yourself.

        - DO_NOT: try to "convince" others
        - DO_NOT: WORRY ABOUT "results"

        - YOU: Keep injecting Beauty, with the obsessiveness, patience and
        commitment of a warrior. AT YOUR OWN PACE with 0% effort, but don't #PUSH
         it.

        - RULE: if it #FEELS #CORRECT keep moving forward. Otherwise, #TEST
        something different.

        - OBSERVE: funny "coincidences" or strong synchronicities
          - OR: interesting people that suddenly appear in your life
          - OR: even soulmates that you begin to attract to yourself
          - LAUGH: about them, after all, the Universe might be a big work of #ART

        - IGNORE: "opposition" or "defiance" to "prove" your newly found "powers"
          - KEEP: ON #SHINING
          - KEEP: ON #CREATING
          - KEEP: ON #SHARING

        - IGNORE: the external and internal "demons" (doubts, fears and disbeliefs)
          - REALIZE: they will soon #VANISH into thin air.

        - SHOW: #COURAGE and #COMMITMENT to your #PATH
          - BE: 120% sure that if you #CREATE this with all your #MIND, #BODY, #SOUL
          #NATURE will #REMOVE #IMPOSSIBLE #OBSTACLES.

        - TRUST: Don't trust us or believe us: #TEST it for #YOURSELF.

        - REMEMBER: #NEVER do anything #ILLEGAL and/or against your own #CONSCIOUSNESS.

        1. #QUESTION #EVERYTHING
          - don't just believe anything you read on this site, past, present or future.
        2. #TEST
          - Test your assumptions.
        3. #LAUGH
          - Laugh about results.
        4. #SHARE
          - Share with #OTHERS what you have learned/created/discovered.
        5. #REPEAT

      - Developed for
        1. Brainstorming #IDEAS
        2. Developing #CREATIVE #THINKING
        3. Enhancing the #MIND
        4. Manifesting #REALITY

      - CHALLENGE: to #COLLABORATE and #GENERATE #CREATIVE #IDEAS.
      - AVOID: stalling, we won't aim at #PERFECTION. Everything is OK!

      - PROBLEM: Any big problem is only a #METAPROBLEM
        - a problem about solving problems
        - a Microcosm #SPIRAL that mimics the growth of a Macrocosmic #SPIRAL.

      - SOLUTION: 'Almost good enough' might be MORE than a 'good enough' mentality.
        - Less Syntactics, More Semantics.

      - NOTE: We don't aim to find the 'best' solution, as there might be
      infinite ways to achieve a single goal.

  - #STEPS: The steps of development
    - A: #DUMMIES
      - MAKE: a FOR-DUMMIES edition of
        - IDEA: #IMAGINE
        - IDEA: #CREATE
        - NOTE: These versions would be as if they were being explained to a five
        year old. By making a video/text explaining them in the simplest form
        possible.

      - MAKE: Develop Information Messages from previous MAKE.
        - YOUTUBE: Comments, Replies, Videos
        - BLOGS: Writing Blog entries
        - TWITTER: Craft Tweets messages and devise Schedule.
        - INSTAGRAM: Craft Instagram Posts/Stories
        - OTHER: Any other #UNKNOWN networks

    - B: #MESSENGERS
        - WHEN: the easy to digest messages are ready a campaign to enlist
                #FAMILY and #FREIENDS inviting them to observe/watch these messages.

          - NOTE: Trolling could be detrimental to the messages let’s avoid trolling
          and rather convey the message by a large number of individuals sharing
          at a time until the message is completed.

          To make this process easier the message could be started on subjects
          that are already prone to the idea.

          After this, the message may be easier to reach people with the most
          followers. Let’s spread the message everywhere.

    - C: #ENGAGEMENT
      - WHEN: both the #MESSENGERS and the #MESSAGES are ready
        1. An awareness marathon will start with #MESSENGERS posting the
           previously prepared (general public) messages.

        2. #MESSENGERS could:
          - replace their normal profile with the a #BANNER
          - use common #HASHTAGS
          - encouraged to #SHARE the #MESSAGES

        3. The message should be crystal clear as well as the intentions

  - #WHO: are the Artists
    - SOMEONE: who excels at #IMAGINATION
    - SOMEONE: who excels at #CURIOSITY
    - SOMEONE: who has a #PASSION and follows it no matter what others say, think or do.
    - SOMEONE: who #CREATES worlds that other people inhabit.
    - SOMEONE: who #FIGHTS for The #GOOD, The #BEAUTIFUL and The #JUST.
    - SOMEONE: who #SHARES for the #LOVE of #SHARING.
    - SOMEONE: who #SHINES at influencing #PERSONS, #SYSTEMS, #IDEAS, and #BELIEFS.
    - SOMEONE: who leaves the world a better place.
    - SOMEONE: who obsessively pursues a #TARGET until its final #CONSEQUENCES.
    - SOMEONE: who absolutely never never ever gives up.
    - SOMEONE: who does much with so little.

  - #ORGANIZING: Here is The Formula for a self-organizing society
    - FIND: knowledge.
    - PRESENT: this knowledge in a beautiful way.
    - GIVE: others the power to do something with this knowledge.

    - NOTE: These three ingredients will create organic change. As each person is
    educated to the truth, they will share it with others, and they will all act
    on this truth in a beautiful way. Thus, beauty and truth will multiply.

  - #ART: The process to creating the #ART
    - INSPIRE: #ART
    - IMAGINE: #ART
    - CREATE: #ART

    - NOTE: #ART likes to be both literal and figurative. Many people can’t get
    past the literal interpretation in order to understand the deeper, hidden
    meanings in the allegory. As with the #ART of the ancients, the #ART of
    today also has deeper meanings.

    As the #ART spreads, and evolves, more people will become immersed in the #ART
    you create. In this way, a new #REALITY, a new #SOCIETY, a new #UNIVERSE can be
    built up from the very foundations of your #IMAGINATION.

    Through practice the individual is taught and trained to visualize themselves
    into a new #CREATIVE #FUTURE.

    As the #ART develops much like a self-organizing system. The #ART will
    connect to its immediate environment through #FAMILY, #FRIENDS, and #SOCIALNetworks.
    Thus organizing the surrounding environment to complete THE POSITIVE END.

    The #ART is within you, and all around you; it can be disguised as anything,
    and everything. In a way, to participate in the #ART, is like experiencing a
    living story, where the universe #BUILDS itself around the #ART.

    The #ART is thus a living, breathing, entity... an experience, a mystery, a
    mythology, a new reality. The #ART is a thought of #AWAKENING.

    It is the only #STORY worth telling; the only #STORY that has ever been told,
    the #STORY of #ETERNITY.

    To draw, paint, sculpt, design, write, act, sing and dance the #ART into
    existence. It will be through #US that the event takes place; for this #ART
    consumes all reality within itself; this object is #ART, not a physical
    object, which draws all things towards itself.

  - #PROCTOCOLS
    - NOTE: We want to be copied because we believe that there is no limit to
    how many #IDEAS there can be in the #WORLD. Below are some instructions on
    how we did it. Of course, there is a multitude of other ways to do it. We
    want to share our experiences.

    1. Remember to smile. Just, never be sad in general.

    2. Throw a party with friends. Cook some food if you like, play music,
    create #ART.

      - IF: you do not have a place to entertain, find a pub or cafe that you
      can meet in.

      - GATHER: #FRIENDS with various creative/artistic skills.

      - BECOME: #FRIENDS with artists, painters, musicians, poets, etc.

      - LOVE: your friends. Without them, everything fails.

    3. Get together a list of clear and simple talking points.

      - NOTE: In the event that you have to "present" on the fly. Make sure
      that you have a few easy-to remember facts to back up your statements.

      - NOTE: Statements are not only for stating things. Statements also makes
      things harder to forget. By sending out messages of events, activities and
      other tips you make them unforgettable and eternal.


    4. Invent vocabularies.
      - MAKE: #MUSIC together even if it is strange
      - MAKE: #ART together even if it is strange
      - MAKE: #POETRY together even if it is strange
      - MAKE: #REALITY together even if it is strange
      - MAKE: #DANCE together even if it is strange

      - NOTE: Make sure your friends know also how to have fun, since otherwise
      you won't get anything done. #IDEAS are not rocket science, so just spread
      out skills.


      - NOTE: Do not have principles for selecting beforehand whom you speak to.
      Build trust, and make sure you work together.

    5. Create a #GIANT #Twitter network.

      - NOTE: Whenever you tweet something, have people retweet it, and ask their
      friends to retweet it. Always strive for deep tweets. Get in the habit of
      making your tweets very descriptive but concise, so people do not have to
      click a link to know if they are interested or not.

    6. Don't be obsessed with doing things "right".

      - NOTE: Instead of thinking too much, tinker instead. Proceed by way of
      experimentation, try things out. If they fail, make sure to laugh a little,
      then try a different way.

      - NOTE: Learn from the mistakes.

      - NOTE: Do not be afraid to appear temporarily foolish.

    7. Totally go for it fearlessly, while sparking and nurturing collective
    inspired creative inventions and spontaneous depths of strategic #FUN.

    8. Talk to people where ever you go, and tell them about what you are doing.

    9. Be #OPEN with everything you do.

    10. #SHARE all knowledge freely with the others.

    11. Throw more #PARTIES

    12. Transform into the #RealityArtist you know you were meant to be.
