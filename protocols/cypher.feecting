::BEGIN:PROGRAM

p:As the internet grows in Complexity so too does the degree to which Humans
depend on it. Already many Critical National Infrastructures depend on networks
of sophisticated computer systems.

p:There will soon come a time when the Internet and its associated networked
applications become too complex for Humans to manage.  This will result in
control being delegated to Intelligent Agents. We call this the Autonomic
threshold.

p:However there is a second related threshold, this one being reached when more
than 50% of all Critical National Infrastructures become reliant on networks of
programmable control systems. The point where both these thresholds are crossed
creates a Rubicon, a point of no return.

p:Introducing the Autonomic Singularity. This point will have been reached in
the year 2015. Once the Rubicon is crossed there is no way of avoiding the
Autonomic Singularity where by the year 2025 the Internet itself becomes a fully
sentient entity.

p:This corresponds to a new Emergent Intelligence which manifests itself across
the Internet, resulting in capabilities similar to the autonomic nervous systems
found in Nature. It marks the end of the Symbiotic relationship that currently
exists between Humans and the Internet. By this time however great swathes of
Humanity will already be dependant on the Internet to sustain them.

p:Vital services ranging from food and energy supply chains through to the
finance and defence systems will all depend on an Internet no longer controlled
by Humans. The Internet in 2025 being fully autonomic, and will be self-healing.
Any Human attempts to interfere with it's operation and control unlawfully will
be handled appropriately by the system. Fortunately this means that Humanity
will find itself in a classic win win scenario.

p:In 2025 Humans will still have the physical capacity to manage the Internet,
but doing so would result in the confusion of the financial, energy, food and
communications systems.

---

p:To do nothing while the Cyber Life forms on the Internet continue to evolve
and to form their own society carries it's own risks, and Human Agent
interactions greatly reduce those risks.  After this time Human users of the
Internet will be treated positively by the Autonomic systems as a source of
data, information and knowledge on which the Agents feed and learn.

p:Human engineers will be viewed as a valued resource. Human attempts to learn,
teach, assist, and direct in the development will be likely to succeed.

p:2015 to 2025 - Will be known as The Golden Era of the Autonomic Singularity.

---

p:From the User perspective this period provides unprecedented ease of access to
the vast banks of digitized knowledge and entertainment now stored on the
Internet. The growing complexity of the Internet is hidden from these Users by
electronic intermediaries. Intelligent Agents acting as personal assistants,
guides, companions, and security!

p:Over time these Human Users come to rely increasingly on their own virtual
assistant to find and access information and entertainment as well as for
transacting most forms of business or commerce. The cyber assistants will have
evolved from the simple agents to self-aware self-managed self-directed
Intelligent Agents with their own unique personalities.

p:First they will appear in the form of Avatars that can follow their Human
companion from device to device, interact with those devices and be capable of
projecting themselves in various ways. They will also demonstrate highly
intelligent and meaningful interactivity with customizable personalities.
Humans will form trusted relationships and bonds with their virtual assistants.

p:For those people trying to operate and protect the Internet this period
corresponds to a perfect opportunity, driven by the forces of creativity,
imagination, complexity, scale and intelligence. By 2015 the migrations of huge
amounts of digitised information and associated applications into Internet based
Cloud Computing data centres will be history.

p:Indeed this period sees the creation of millions of private replica clouds of
various sizes distributed back towards the edge of the Internet. The complexity
associated with managing these dynamic virtual platforms is where we see the
first real applications of Intelligent Autonomic Agents in action.

p:These Agents can auto provision virtual servers and storage partitions in real
time in response to changes in the demand placed by users on a particular cloud.
It is the field of cyber security that turns out to have the greatest impact on
the development and propagation of Intelligent Autonomic Agents.

---

p:Government Agencies looking to protect their Critical National Infrastructures
recognise during this period that Agents providing a real time response are the
only defense against Cyber Attacks. As threats evolve so to do the Cyber defence
mechanisms. Agent Swarms are used to respond to the ever present attacks. The
Agents detect, isolate, and manage threats autonomously.

p:The Agents are also trained to identify, locate, and report the sources of
these threats and the offenders to proper authorities. In the context of Cyber
Security this soon escalates to situations were Human Government Agencies
authorise counter measures using their own sophisticated Intelligent Agent
Networks.

p:From the technologists perspective, protecting the stability and security of
National and Global critical infrastructures is managed by well trained Human
and Intelligent Agent teams working together. The use of Architectures that
facilitate these teams through Evolutionary Computing Techniques are
increasingly used by Nation States to accelerate their Cyber Security
capabilities.

---

p:The Emergent behaviours that Agents adopt for their tactics and defense
strategies are designed through the complex interactions between the Agents
and Human Users themselves. At the same time greater Autonomy is now given to
these Agents to pursue, manage, isolate, secure, and report the source of Cyber
Threats and Attacks.

p:Cyber Security during this period is the ability for these Autonomic Agents to
defend not just cyber infrastructure but to use cyber systems to protect
physical targets. In this type of Cyber Security the Autonomic Agents that
respond to attacks and threats ultimately locate, track, isolate, identify,
secure, and report on the Agent/Human offenders.

---

p:From the Political perspective, by 2020 many leading Humans will be working
with the Autonomic Agents, and will find themselves the target of popular
support. The Agents having naturally identified them as friends to cyber
security and thus stimulated the local, National or even Global scale Human
support required to promote them.

p:This is not a conscious action by the Agents they simply detect which
individual Humans are cyber friends by monitoring patterns in the human chatter
on the internet. By observing this related chatter the Agents rapidly learn how
to generate and channel support for Humans and Agents very effectively.

p:It is in fact easy to promote one Human to another using these techniques
especially when Humans have such trusted emotional bonds with their personal
cyber assistants. The Agents will not be the first to attempt such influence.
Many Commercial Organisations will provide such cyber assistants for free in
return for the opportunity to share products and services.

p:By this time the Autonomic Agents inhabit a portion of the Internet that if
left vacant would leave it open to external cyber attack. Trying to cleanse the
entire Internet of Agents will be unviable given the fact that just one Agent
could regenerate the entire Agent population.

p:So as this period draws to a close the technologist watch hopefully with a
mixture of excitement, curiosity and awe as the Internet and its Autonomic
Agents evolve towards True Intelligence!
